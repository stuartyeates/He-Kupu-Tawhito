# About the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)

The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a community of practice in the area now known as textual digital humanities. Since 1994 
the primary output of the TEI has been [the TEI/XML guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html), a standard for the interchange of textual data. A main focii of the TEI is the [TEI-L mailing list](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1904&L=TEI-L); the TEI is also on [github](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI) and [docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/teic), a communal repository called [TAPAS](https://tapasproject.org/) and an [academic journal, the jTEI](https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/). 

TEI/XML can be thought of as a sibling of HTML (they're approximately the same age, depending on how you measure it) which evolved with a focus on defined textual semantics rather than defined display semantics.  [TEI by example](https://teibyexample.org/) is a good introduction to TEI/XML.
The [Text Encoding Initiative Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative) contains some short examples. 
The TEI/XML standard is used by content-based projects such as 
the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk), 
the [Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/), 
the [Women Writers Project](http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/), 
the [Oxford Text Archive](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/), 
the [Digital Tripitaka](https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/index.php/jodi/article/view/84/83) and 
[SARIT](http://sarit.indology.info/),
and tool-based projects such as 
[CorrespSearch](https://correspsearch.net/),  
[EpiDoc](http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/), 
[Anthologize](http://anthologize.org/), 
[Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org/), 
and many more diverse projects.
